TwitchSwitch
=========

Chrome web extension that allows users to preview other streams without navigating away from the current stream.

Current Situation:
----------

When the user is watching a stream on twitch.tv and he/she is interested in knowing what their other favorite streamers are doing, the only way this can be accomplished is by closing the current stream and opening a new one or by opening another stream in a new tab

TwitchSwitch Solution:
----------

TwitchSwitch ameliorates this inconvenience by adding a list of followed streamers to the sidebar. When you are watching a stream, you can simply click on the streamer on a sidebar and a preview of their stream will appear along with the option to switch to watching that stream. No navigation required!
